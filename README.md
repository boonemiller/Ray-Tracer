# Ray-Tracer
Ray Tracer implementation in C++, Random Sample AA, multi-threading, and runtime comparisons on different CPUs

### Introduction

Described in this README and the code in this repo is a personal project on a basic raytracing implementation.
Added features on top of the basic ray tracer include random sample per pixel anti-aliasing and multithreading support. 
I described the features of the ray-tracer and included a performance report of multithreading the ray tracer on three different Intel processors.
